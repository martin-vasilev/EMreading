SingleLine(
  data_list = NULL,
  ResX = 1920,
  ResY = 1080,
  maxtrial = 999,
  tBlink = 150,
  textStim = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data_list}{Input of data files to be processed. This can be specified in three ways:
\enumerate{
\item a directory that contains all the files (it will select all files ending with ".asc",
and order them by participant number, if present).
\item Directory to a txt file that contains all the .asc data file names inside:
e.g., data_list= "C:/My Data/data_list.txt".
In the .txt file, the directory for each .asc data file should appear on a separate row,
e.g.: C:/My Data/subject1.asc /n
C:/My Data/subject2.asc
\item A directory to a single .asc file: e.g., data_list= "C:/My Data/subject1.asc".
}}

\item{ResX}{X screen resolution in pixels}

\item{ResY}{Y screen resolution in pixels}

\item{maxtrial}{Maximum number of trials in the experiment}

\item{tBlink}{Time in milliseconds for detecting blinks before or after fixation.
If there is a blink x milliseconds before or after the fixation, it will be marked
as having a blink. The default is 50 ms.}

\item{textStim}{An optional parameter for cases when the text stimuli are not printed
to the .asc files. If this is the case, please provide a directory to a txt file
containing the stimuli sentences used in the experiment. Each sentences should be
placed on a new line and the stimuli should be ordered in the way that they were presented
in the experiment (i.e., sentence 1 should be on line 1 and so on). You will also need
to provide information about the width of letters and the offset of the text on the
x-axis (see below). The default is NULL for cases when the text stimuli are printed
to the .asc files.}

\item{ppl}{Pixels per letter in the experiment (i.e., the width of each letter on the
screen). Please note that this function currently works only with fixed-width (i.e.,
monospaced) fonts. Not needed if the text stimuli were printed to the data.}

\item{xOffset}{Offset of the text in pixels on the x-axis of the screen. This should be
the pixel location where the first letter of the sentence starts. Not needed if the text
stimuli were printed to the data.}

\item{plot}{A logical indicating whether to plot the raw and re-aligned fixations
as an image file. The default is TRUE. If set to FALSE, no images will be plotted.
Note that plotting images will generally take longer time to pre-process the data.
The images are saved in the current working directory in the folder "img".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the data
}
\description{
This function reads in data from .asc files and performs the pre-processing.
