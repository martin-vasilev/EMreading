\arguments{
\item{raw_fix}{Dataframe containing the raw fixation data that were extracted with the
EMreading package}

\item{removeOutsideText}{A logical inicating whether to remove all fixations outside the text
and/or screen area. The default is TRUE.}

\item{removeBlinks}{A logical indicating whether to exclude all blinks from the data. The
default (and recommended) setting is TRUE.}

\item{combineNearbySmallFix}{A logical indicating whether to merge small fixations < 80 ms
that are within 1 character space of another fixation (the small fixation will be merged with
the nearby fixation). The default is TRUE.}

\item{combineMethod}{Method for combining small fixations. Accepted values are "char" for
combaining based on a distance in characters and "pix" for combining based on distance in
pixels. The default is "char".}

\item{combineDist}{Distance for combining small fixations. Small fixations will be combined
only if they occur within this distance of another fixation. Based on the input to
'combineMethod' above, enter a numeric value either in number of characters or in number of
pixels. The default is 1 (characters).}

\item{removeSmallFix}{A logical indicating whether to remove any remaining fixations smaller
than a certain cut-off. The default is TRUE}

\item{smallFixCutoff}{A numerical value indiciating the cut-off for removing small
fixations (the default is 80 ms). Any values smaller than this number will be removed.}

\item{removeOutliers}{A logical indicating whether to remove outliers from the data (default
is TRUE). This parameter also requires the specification of a method and cutoff for
outlier exclusion (see below)}

\item{outlierMethod}{A string indicating what type of outlier exclusion method to use.
Allowed are 2 methods: "ms" for exclusion of fixations based on a number in milliseconds;
or "std" for exlusion based on values that are a certain number of standard deviations above
the subject's mean.}

\item{outlierCutoff}{Numerical value that specifies the cut-off for removing outliers. If you
chose "ms" in "outlierMethod", please specify a number in ms (e.g., 800). if you chose "std",
please enter a number in standard deviations above the mean (e.g., 3).}

\item{keepRS}{A logical indicating whether to keep return sweep fixations from merging (FALSE by default)}

\item{silent}{A logical indicating whether to print output regarding merged fixations.
Set to FALSE if you don't want this output (default is TRUE).}
